## Traveling waves background

- This work was a followup to Derek AT Cummings paper on the traveling waves of Thailand (2004)
- That paper used wavelet analysis on Thailand to show that there were was inter-annual synchrony between neighboring provinces and multi-annual trends ("waves") in dengue that pulsed from Bangkok to the rest of the country
    - Used data from 1983-1997
- This paper extends wavelets to the provinces of 8 countries in Southeast Asia and incorporates weather information
    - Using data from 1993-2010
